# Analyzing FitBit Data
In this project, I analyzed my own FitBit data that was recovered from the FitBit database. I referred to the site for instructions on how to export my data here: https://help.fitbit.com/articles/en_US/Help_article/1133.htm

Please refer to my fitbit_data_analysis.ipynb file to see my data analysis.

### Data Analysis Process
The steps I followed were:
1. Exporting data
2. Cleaning data
3. Forming exploratory analysis questions
4. Performing data analysis/ creating visualizations

Provided more time, I would have also made some predictions and found relationships between the data (i.e. logistic regressions and chi squared tests).
